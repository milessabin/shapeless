enthusiasm and encouragement.

This is primarily a bugfix release. The most significant changes are,

* Fixed a macro hygiene bug in Generic1 (thanks to Alexandre
  Archambault)

* Several fixes and improvements in HList and Coproduct rotations
  (thanks to Alexandre Archambault).

* Added a prepend operation for Coproducts. Prepend of an HList to HNil
  no longer rebuilds the entire HList (thanks to Alexandre Archambault).

* Added a method to transform the value at the focus of a Zipper (thanks
  to Peter Schmitz)

* Added an example illustrating the use of a coproduct Generic
  representation of an ADT to model a safe enumeration.

* shapeless in now built with SBT 0.13.8.
