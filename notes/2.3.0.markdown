This is the final release of [shapeless-2.3.0][shapeless]. These release notes provide a summary of changes since
shapeless 2.2.5.

### Prominent changes

84 pull requests have been merged and 55 issues have been closed and since 2.2.5 ... the complete list can be found in
the 2.3.0 github milestone for [issues][230issues] and [PRs][230prs].

The project branch and build structure has been completely reworked. shapeless is now built for all permutations
of Scala 2.10/11/12 and JVM and Scala.js from a single branch using [macro-compat][macro-compat] and the new support
for JUnit in Scala.js 0.6.6+.

There are a large number of new features, refactorings and bug fixes in shapeless 2.3.0. The most significant of these
are,

#### ADTs

* Many bug fixes and improvements in the implementation of Generic.
* Many bug fixes and improvements in the implementations of Generic1, IsHCons1, IsCons1 and Split1 in support of
  [Kittens][kittens].
* Added Annotation and Annotations type classes providing evidence of the presence of annotations on a type, or on the
  elements or constructors of an ADT.
* Added Default, AsRecord and AsOptions type classes providing evidence of the default values for the constructors of
  product types as HLists of Options or records.
* LabelledGeneric[T] no longer extends Generic[T].

#### HLists/Coproducts/tuples/records

* Dramatically improved compile time performance for record select and update.
* Added zipWithIndex method and ZipWithIndex type class for HLists, Coproducts and tuples.
* Added ToCoproduct/ToSum type classes for HLists and tuples.
* Added toCoproduct method and ToCoproductTraversable type class allowing conversion of an HList to a homogenous
  collection of the Coproduct of its element types.
* Added selectMany, selectManyType and selectRange methods and SelectMany and SelectRange type classes allowing
  elements of an HList to be selected given a set or range of Nat indices.
* Added group method and Grouper and PaddedGrouper type classes allowing HLists and tuples to be subdivided into
  smaller tuples of a given size.
* Added union, intersect, diff methods and Union, Intersection and Diff type classes supporting set-like operations on
  HLists.
* Added updateAtWith method and ModifierAt type class supporting functional update of elements of HLists and tuples at
  a given Nat index.
* Added collectFirst method and CollectFirst type class which applies a Poly to the first compatible element of an
  HList.
* Added LiftAll type class which collects instances of a type class for each element of an HList.
* Added padTo and slice methods and PadTo and Slice type classes which support padding and slicing HLists to/by Nat
  indices.
* Added toRecord method and FromMap type class which supports type safe conversion of a homogenous Map to a record.
* Added remove and removeAll methods and Remove and RemoveAll type classes supporting removing of one or more fields
  from a record. These operations are reversible via reinsert and reinsertAll.
* Added toSizedHList method and ToSizedHList type class which support conversion of a homogenous collection to an
  HList of a known size.
* Improved readability of toString for nested HLists.
* Improved toString for Coproducts.

#### Infrastructure

* cachedImplicit now uses a more reliable mechanism for preventing self-loops.
* Added Strict and Cached type constructors which modify the semantics of Lazy by eliminating unnecessary closures and
  by sharing instances respectively.
* Added LowPriority mechanism for controlling the priority of instances during implicit resolution.
* User supplied @implicitNotFound annotations are now propagated through `Lazy`.
* Added NatProductArgs which allows argument lists of Int literals to be mapped to HLists of Nats.
* Added Range, GCD, LCM, GT and GTEq type classes for Nats.
* Added NatWith which supports conversion of Int literals to Nat values and simultaneously summoning a specified type
  class at the corresponding Nat type.
* Added Widen type class which allows the widening of a singleton type and value to the corresponding non-singleton
  type.
* Added runtimeList method allowing conversion of an HList to a List[Any] efficiently when precise types are not
  needed.
* Added unwrapped method and Unwrapped type class which allow access to the value underlying a newtype or value class.
* The experimental support for lifting polymorphic methods to Poly values has been removed.

### Source and binary compatibility

shapless 2.3.0 is source compatible with 2.2.5. As indicated by the version number bump, however, shapeless 2.3.0 is
not binary compatible with shapeless 2.2.x.
